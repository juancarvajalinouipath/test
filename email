Subject: Hours Reconciliation: V1.1 Production Move & January 26th

Hi [Project Manager Name],

I’m writing to coordinate the compensation for the version 1.1 production move that took place overnight from 8:00 PM Thursday to 3:00 AM Friday (7 hours).

To keep my hours balanced, I’d like to combine these 7 hours with the 1 hour remaining from the January 18th deployment (where I worked 9 hours from 8:00 PM – 5:00 AM, but only 8 were applied toward December 28th).

This brings the total to 8 hours, which I would like to use to cover my shift this coming Monday, January 26th.

Please let me know if this works for your tracking, or if you would prefer I log these as overtime instead.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
